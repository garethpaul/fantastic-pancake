All sections look well-structured and informative. Consider adding a small introduction or summary that ties together the different sections, giving an overview of the delightful world of pancakes. This could serve as a welcoming paragraph to entice readers to explore further. Adding a bullet point about how to adjust cooking times for different pancake sizes in the pancake tips section might also be beneficial.
